# Verification

This document binds the local and CI verification contract for the developer
platform infrastructure core. It exists so every instance and every reviewer
can re-run the same gates.

## Local gates

Run from the repository root with the pinned Go toolchain (`go 1.26`,
`toolchain go1.26.6`) and the pinned OpenTofu engine (`1.12.5` on `PATH`):

```text
gofmt
go test ./...
go run -mod=readonly ./cmd/check-coverage
go run -mod=readonly ./cmd/build
```

`cmd/build` is the full source-level gate: Go formatting, module checksums,
module metadata, build tool download, build tool checksums, build tool
metadata, lint (staticcheck), unit tests, exact 100% statement coverage,
race detector, static analysis, fail-closed vulnerability analysis
(govulncheck), Lefthook configuration validation, Linux/AMD64 build of the
gate binaries with module provenance, and the OpenTofu gates — engine
version verification, recursive `tofu fmt -check`, and
`tofu init -backend=false` plus `tofu validate` for every foundation area.

## Build tooling

Build tools live in the separate `tools/` module and are resolved through
its own verified `go.mod` and committed `go.sum`; they never join the source
module graph. The module pins `govulncheck`, `staticcheck`, and `lefthook`
via the Go tool directive and shares the repository toolchain pin.

## Toolchain and vulnerability re-scans

The Go toolchain is pinned exactly (`toolchain go1.26.6`,
`GOTOOLCHAIN=local`); CI asserts `go env GOVERSION` before any gate runs and
no lane may download a toolchain at build time. `govulncheck` is part of the
full source gate, and CI re-runs the full gate on a daily schedule so newly
disclosed vulnerabilities in the pinned toolchain or dependency graph fail
closed even without source changes.

The OpenTofu gates run with `OPENTOFU_ENFORCE_GPG_VALIDATION=true`,
`TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true` and `TF_INPUT=false`. Provider downloads land in the
repository-local plugin cache under `.build/`, which is never committed.
Foundation-area lock files stay local; only reference stacks commit their
`.terraform.lock.hcl`.

## Test architecture

Every executable Go package carries same-package whitebox tests for its
invariants, branches, state transitions, errors, and cleanup paths.
`internal/packaging/` complements them with same-package workflow contract
tests that bind the CI surface, the Rulesets, the foundation-area layout, the
exact OpenTofu pins and the core boundary (no concrete organization, tenant,
project, identity, network, secret or registry bindings anywhere in the
core).

## CI gates

The `Quality gates (linux-amd64)` check runs the full source-level gate with
the pinned Go and OpenTofu toolchains on every push and pull request to the
shared lines and once per day on a schedule. The `Dependency admission review`
check blocks unreviewed dependency changes. CodeQL code scanning runs with all
alerts blocking once the shared-line Rulesets are imported.

Lefthook provides the local `commit-msg` hook (governed commit-message
validation) and the pre-push source-quality gate.

## Instance consumption

An organization instance consumes this core through exact module version pins
(for example a git source with an immutable `?ref=` version) and supplies the
concrete project IDs, regions, OIDC bindings, members and retention values as
reviewed instance configuration. An instance never copies the module source
into its own boundary; it references the pinned version and proves the binding
in its own evidence.
