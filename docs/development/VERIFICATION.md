# Verification

This document binds the local and CI verification contract for the developer
platform infrastructure core. It exists so every instance and every reviewer
can re-run the same gates.

## Local gates

Run from the repository root with the pinned Go toolchain (`go 1.26`,
`toolchain go1.26.6`):

```text
gofmt
go test ./...
go tool -modfile tools/go.mod check-coverage
go tool -modfile tools/go.mod quality-gate
```

`quality-gate` executes the canonical gate chain of the go-quality-authority
territory home through the pinned tooling module: Go formatting, module
checksums, module metadata, build tool download, build tool checksums, build
tool metadata, lint (staticcheck), unit tests, exact 100% statement coverage,
race detector, static analysis, fail-closed vulnerability analysis
(govulncheck), and Lefthook configuration validation.

The OpenTofu gates are pack-owned: the canonical quality lane resolves the
declared `opentofu@1` pack, provisions the pinned engine through its digest-
and signature-bound recipe (`quality-gate provision`), and runs the engine
version assertion, the recursive `tofu fmt -check`, and
`tofu init -backend=false` plus `tofu validate` for every discovered HCL
root — the foundation areas and the hosting-platform projection areas. A
local pack-gate run uses the same two commands and requires the cosign
verifier on the lane for the signature proof.

## Build tooling

Build tools live in the separate `tools/` module and are resolved through
its own verified `go.mod` and committed `go.sum`; they never join the source
module graph. The module pins `govulncheck`, `staticcheck`, and `lefthook`
via the Go tool directive and shares the repository toolchain pin. It also
pins the governed quality tools — `quality-gate` and `check-coverage` from
the go-quality-authority home and `verify-canonical` from the
repository-governance home — and requires the supply-chain-governance shared
kernel, so the capability-pack registry resolves at the pinned stand.

## Toolchain and vulnerability re-scans

The Go toolchain is pinned exactly (`toolchain go1.26.6`,
`GOTOOLCHAIN=local`); CI asserts `go env GOVERSION` before any gate runs and
no lane may download a toolchain at build time. `govulncheck` is part of the
full source gate, and CI re-runs the full gate on a daily schedule so newly
disclosed vulnerabilities in the pinned toolchain or dependency graph fail
closed even without source changes.

The OpenTofu gates run with the pack-bound environment
(`OPENTOFU_ENFORCE_GPG_VALIDATION=true`, `TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true`,
`TF_INPUT=false`). Provider downloads land in the repository-local plugin
cache under `.build/`, which is never committed. Foundation-area and
projection-area lock files stay local; no lock file is committed.

## Test architecture

Every executable Go package carries same-package whitebox tests for its
invariants, branches, state transitions, errors, and cleanup paths.
`internal/packaging/` complements them with same-package workflow contract
tests that bind the canonical caller byte-identity and pins to the tenant
binding manifest, the canonical file family, the conformance lane, the
capability-pack declaration, the organization rule-set adoption guard, the
foundation-area layout, the exact OpenTofu pins, the value-free
hosting-platform projection areas and the core boundary (no concrete
organization, tenant, project, identity, network, secret or registry
bindings anywhere in the core).

## CI gates

The `Quality gates / linux-amd64` check runs the canonical quality gate of
the repository-governance home with the pinned Go toolchain and the
provisioned `opentofu@1` pack on every push and pull request to the shared
lines and once per day on a schedule. The `Canonical conformance` check
proves the canonical bindings of this repository fail-closed. The
`Dependency review / Dependency admission review` check blocks unreviewed
dependency changes. CodeQL code scanning runs with all alerts blocking; the
binding of this repository is documented in
`docs/conventions/hosting-plattform/github/rule-sets/`.

Lefthook provides the local `commit-msg` hook (governed commit-message
validation) and the canonical pre-push validation.

## Instance consumption

An organization instance consumes this core through exact module version pins
(for example a git source with an immutable `?ref=` version) and supplies the
concrete project IDs, regions, OIDC bindings, members and retention values as
reviewed instance configuration. An instance never copies the module source
into its own boundary; it references the pinned version and proves the binding
in its own evidence.
