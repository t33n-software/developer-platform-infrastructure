# Verification

This document binds the local and CI verification contract for the developer
platform infrastructure core. It exists so every instance and every reviewer
can re-run the same gates.

## Local gates

Run from the repository root with the pinned Go toolchain (`go 1.26`,
`toolchain go1.26.5`) and the pinned OpenTofu engine (`1.12.5` on `PATH`):

```text
gofmt
go test ./...
go run -mod=readonly ./cmd/check-coverage
go run -mod=readonly ./cmd/build
```

`cmd/build` is the full source-level gate: Go formatting, module checksums,
module metadata, unit tests, exact 100% statement coverage, race detector,
static analysis, Linux/AMD64 build of the gate binaries with module
provenance, and the OpenTofu gates — engine version verification, recursive
`tofu fmt -check`, and `tofu init -backend=false` plus `tofu validate` for
every foundation area.

The OpenTofu gates run with `OPENTOFU_ENFORCE_GPG_VALIDATION=true`,
`TF_IN_AUTOMATION=true` and `TF_INPUT=false`. Provider downloads land in the
repository-local plugin cache under `.build/`, which is never committed.
Foundation-area lock files stay local; only reference stacks commit their
`.terraform.lock.hcl`.

## Test architecture

Every executable Go package carries same-package whitebox tests for its
invariants, branches, state transitions, errors, and cleanup paths.
`internal/packaging/` complements them with same-package workflow contract
tests that bind the CI surface, the Rulesets, the foundation-area layout, the
exact OpenTofu pins and the core boundary (no concrete organization, tenant,
project, identity, network, secret or registry bindings anywhere in the
core).

## CI gates

The `Quality gates (linux-amd64)` check runs the full source-level gate with
the pinned Go and OpenTofu toolchains. The `Dependency admission review` check
blocks unreviewed dependency changes. CodeQL code scanning runs with all
alerts blocking once the shared-line Rulesets are imported.

## Instance consumption

An organization instance consumes this core through exact module version pins
(for example a git source with an immutable `?ref=` version) and supplies the
concrete project IDs, regions, OIDC bindings, members and retention values as
reviewed instance configuration. An instance never copies the module source
into its own boundary; it references the pinned version and proves the binding
in its own evidence.
